# Linaro Developer Cloud Website

This is the git repository for the linaro.cloud static Jekyll-based website.

Hosted in this repo are the markdown content files associated with the website. Feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/Linaro/cloud/pulls) / [Issue](https://github.com/Linaro/cloud/issues/new) if there is anything you would like to change.

This static Jekyll site is using the [`jumbo-jekyll-theme`](https://github.com/linaro-marketing/jumbo-jekyll-theme). Please take a moment to review the guides on the [theme's GitHub wiki](https://github.com/linaro-marketing/jumbo-jekyll-theme/wiki).

## Contributing

To make it easier to contribute to the content, Linaro provides a couple of Docker containers for building and checking the site. All you need is Docker installed on your computer and enough RAM and disc space.

To build the site:

```bash
cd <git repository directory>
./build-site.sh
```

To build the site and then serve it so that you can check your contribution appears:

```bash
cd <git repository directory>
JEKYLLACTION="serve" ./build-site.sh
```

To check that your contribution doesn't include any broken links:

```bash
cd <built web site directory>
../check-links.sh
```

The built web site directory will be `production.linaro.cloud`.

For more information, please see the [build container wiki](https://github.com/linaro-its/jekyll-build-container/wiki) and the [link checker wiki](https://github.com/linaro-its/jekyll-link-checker/wiki).

## Adding Redirects to the Static site

We are using [Edge-rewrite](https://github.com/marksteele/edge-rewrite) which is a rewrite engine running in Lambda@Edge. The redirects are to be added to the `_data/routingrules.json` file in the webiste repository following the syntax rules [here](https://github.com/marksteele/edge-rewrite).

```regex
^/oldpath/(\\d*)/(.*)$ /newpath/$2/$1 [L]
!^/oldpath.*$ http://www.example.com [R=302,L,NC]
^/topsecret.*$ [F,L]
^/deadlink.*$ [G]
^/foo$ /bar [H=^baz\.com$]
```

__Note:__ These redirects are currently not respected by the link checker until built. So if trying to fix broken links by adding redirects then this may not be the best way to go about it currently.
