                Since 2010, Linaro Connect has been the event to attend if you are interested in open source software development for Linux,
                tools and the various vertical segment ecosystems that use Arm processors. While the event continues to evolve, one thing
                stays the same â€“ it revolves around engineering and will consist of a mix of industry keynotes, engineering presentations
                and discussions, and collaborative engineering hacking sessions.            
            </p>

                on registration will be available soon.
